# TaskSpot

## TaskSpot a Web for Short-Term Jobs and Tasks


### Initial situation
The project stemmed from recognizing a gap in the market for a platform that provides the connection between individuals or companies needing short-term assistance and those willing to offer their services. 
The main challenge addressed is the lack of a platform for short-term task postings, resulting in missed opportunities for both task seekers and posters; the project aims to fill this gap by providing an efficient solution.


### Projekt Goals
1.	Develop a user-friendly online platform with clear task categories, location-based filtering, and transparent pricing.
2.	Put attention to learning and focus on the backend development.
3.	Make a development timeline with clear milestones, aiming to have the basic website with working backend ready for testing before the end of the second semester.
4.	Collaborate effectively with consistent communication, strategic planning, good teamwork, and regular progress check-ins. 
5.	Regullar project documentation
